# blogList 
There's a bug where on refresh or entering it directly in the adress bar certain endpoints like '/api/blogs/:id/ return a json object{error: "unknown endpoint"}.
since deploying this app is purely for personal purposes i dont have the time to fix this error. it will be done eventually but for now i have to move on to the next stages of the course.
