# blogList 

### Unbuilt client here: https://github.com/Stugeh/FullstackOpen2020/tree/master/part7/blogList/client

CRUD app made with the mern stack where users can manage a database of blogs.

deployed at https://blog-list-improved.herokuapp.com/ production version has some minor routing issues due to react router and back end routing not working together as intended but the app functions apart from those issues.

Bugs: when not logged in the app doesnt give a warning that blog was not added
