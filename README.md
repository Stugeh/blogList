# blogList 
Bugs: when not logged in the app doesnt give a warning that blog was not added

CRUD app made with the mern stack where users can manage a database of blogs. the unbuilt client code can be found here: https://github.com/Stugeh/FullstackOpen2020/tree/master/part7/blogList/client


deployed at https://blog-list-improved.herokuapp.com/ production version has some minor routing issues due to react router and back end routing not working together as intended but the app functions apart from those issues.
